        <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
        <p>This is my first blog post to kick off my new site.</p>
        <p>The idea of this blog is to share my thoughts and experiences on my journey as a software engineer.</p>
        <p>I'll be writing about my experiences with software development, my thoughts on the industry, and anything
          else that I think is interesting.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure how often I'll be able to write, but I'll do my best to post as often as I can.</p>

        <p>PS: tried to make the site very minimalistic and clean with just CSS and HTML.</p>
